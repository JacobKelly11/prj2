This project was pretty challenging as a lot of the commands did not work in my git bash. I could never get the tar -czf command to work after fiddling with it for a while.
The cal command did not work.
aside from these I did get the other steps to work fine.

Code Review Andrew Mares
Very neatly organized, no missing files, convenient naming convention.
I could not find anything to improve upon, good work!
